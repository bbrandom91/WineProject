# WineProject

I have decided to become a professional wine critic. Alas, I have no taste for the stuff. At most I can distinguish red and white wines. So here's my business plan: rather than actually drinking the wine myself, I will pass the physical characteristics into a machine learning program and have it spit out a score from 1 to 10. This is such a program. As for generating a written review... that sounds neat, but I would not know how to proceed.
I found this dataset on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data is split into two categories: red wine and white wine. Each set per category consists of several chemical properties of a given wine along with a quality score from 1 to 10. My goal is to create a classification algorithm that can predict the quality of wine based on these chemical properties.
